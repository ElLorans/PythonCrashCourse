If you have any questions, please raise an Issue here on Github so that everyone can contribute / see the answer.
Try to do as many exercises as possible.

JupyterExercises containes files for Jupyter, but you can do also the exercises in the folder named PyExercises.
If you "feel bored" and you want to face a harder challenge, please try to solve the exercises in the "FeelBored" folder.

Feel free to ask more/harder exercises and to ask for review.
