# Hello there! Thank you for acquiring your first robot from us, we are sure it is
# going to be a very particular experience for you. If you are scared of apocalyptic
# scenarios where the robots rise and subdue humans, you don’t have to worry,
# because our robots are premium products thoroughly tested with our highest standards.
# Our robot received some damage to its GPS system, now he continuously gets lost!! Will you
# be able to help him?

# Our robot can move among the 4 directions: NORTH, SOUTH, WEST and EAST. When he
# receives the indications he perfectly executes them, only that once he executed them he doesn’t
# know the distance from his starting position.

# You have to create a function named dist that accept as argument a list. The list contains 4
# integers. The first integers represents the total number of steps towards north, the second towards
# south, the third towards west and the fourth towards east. The function should output the
# distance from the starting position.

# Example:
# dist([1,0,1,0])

# Should output:
# 1.4142135623730951
